This is the "Test Benches" example where we tested a working one-bit adder and two broken
one-bit adders.

INSTRUCTIONS:
First, save the brokenadders.v file and the dobroken.do file. This file is configured for 
the functional adder. If you'd like to change the file to test one of the broken adders, 
uncomment one of the lines in the test bench as indicated.

Now if you want to run this code, type "do dobroken.do" into ModelSim's Transcript window, 
and run it by pressing Enter. You should see the results of the test show up in the Transcript 
window.
