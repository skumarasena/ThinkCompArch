This is the "Behavioral vs. Structural" example from "Think Verilog" where we looked at a 
circuit diagram and simulated its behavior in both Structural Verilog and Behavioral Verilog.

INSTRUCTIONS:
First, save the gates.v file and the dogates.do file. Note that this file is configured to 
test the "structuralGates" module. If you'd like to test the ``behavioralGates" module, 
look at the ``testGates" module, uncomment the behavioralGates initialization, and comment
 the structuralGates initialization.

Now if you want to run this code, type "do dogates.do" into ModelSim's Transcript window, 
and run it by pressing Enter. You should see the results of the test show up in the Transcript 
window.
