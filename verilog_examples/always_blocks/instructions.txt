This is the "countingClocks" example from "Think Verilog" where we looked at an example of an
always block and used it to count positive edges of a clock signal.

INSTRUCTIONS:
First, save the always.v file and the doalways.do file. Note that this file is configured to 
test non-blocking assignment. If you'd like to test blocking assignment, uncomment the indicated
lines in the always.v file.

Now if you want to run this code, type "do doalways.do" into ModelSim's Transcript window, 
and run it by pressing Enter. You should see the results of the test show up in the Transcript 
window, and the waveform should pop up in the main window.
